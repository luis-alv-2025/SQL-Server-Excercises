	Customer Behavioral Sequence Analysis (Using CTEs, Window Functions, and Conditional Logic):
	Identify customers who, in their first three purchase transactions, 
	bought products from a different product category each time. 
	Segment these customers into groups based on the specific sequence of their first three category purchases 
	(e.g., 'Bikes -> Components -> Clothing'). 
	The final result should show each unique purchasing sequence and the number of customers who followed that sequence. 

	- Tables: Category, Sub-category, product, Internet sales

	- Columns:
		Sales (productkey, customerkey, orderdatekey)
		product(subcategory key)
		subcategory(category key)
		category(name)

	- Flow: 
		Rank purchases per customer
		Join the necessary tables to get customer, order, and category
		Get first 3 purchases
		Create a matrix with the 3 purchases per customer
		Choose only those rows with distinct purchases
		edit so it looks like a text
